To/TO Sherlock/NNP Holmes/NNP she/PRP is/VBZ always/RB _the_/JJ woman./NN I/PRP have/VBP seldom/RB heard/VBN him/PRP

I/PRP had/VBD seen/VBN little/JJ of/IN Holmes/NNP lately./NNP My/PRP$ marriage/NN had/VBD drifted/VBN us/PRP away/RB

the/DT drowsiness/NN of/IN the/DT drug,/NN and/CC the/DT fierce/JJ energy/NN of/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ keen/JJ

From/IN time/NN to/TO time/NN I/PRP heard/VBD some/DT vague/JJ account/NN of/IN his/PRP$ doings:/NN of/IN his/PRP$

One/CD night—it/NN was/VBD on/IN the/DT twentieth/NN of/IN March,/NNP 1888—I/NNP was/VBD returning/VBG from/IN a/DT

my/PRP$ way/NN led/VBD me/PRP through/IN Baker/NNP Street./NNP As/IN I/PRP passed/VBD the/DT well-remembered/JJ

with/IN the/DT dark/JJ incidents/NNS of/IN the/DT Study/NN in/IN Scarlet,/NN I/PRP was/VBD seized/VBN with/IN a/DT

extraordinary/JJ powers./NNP His/PRP$ rooms/NNS were/VBD brilliantly/RB lit,/JJ and,/NN even/RB as/IN I/PRP 
looked/VBD up,/NN I/PRP saw/VBD his/PRP$ tall,/NN spare/JJ figure/NN pass/VB twice/RB in/IN a/DT dark/JJ silhouette/NN 
against/IN the/DT blind./NN He/PRP was/VBD pacing/NN the/DT room/NN swiftly,/NN eagerly,/NN with/IN his/PRP$ 
head/NN sunk/VBN upon/IN his/PRP$ chest/NN and/CC his/PRP$ hands/NNS clasped/VBD behind/IN him./JJ To/TO me,/VB who/WP 
knew/VBD his/PRP$ every/DT mood/NN and/CC habit,/VB his/PRP$ attitude/NN and/CC manner/NN told/VBD their/PRP$ own/JJ 
story./NN He/PRP was/VBD at/IN work/NN again./RB He/PRP had/VBD risen/VBN out/IN of/IN his/PRP$ drug-created/JJ 
dreams/NNS and/CC was/VBD hot/JJ upon/IN the/DT scent/NN of/IN some/DT new/JJ problem./NN I/PRP rang/VBD the/DT bell/NN 
and/CC was/VBD shown/VBN up/IN to/TO the/DT chamber/NN which/WDT had/VBD formerly/RB been/VBN in/IN part/NN my/PRP$ own./NN 
His/PRP$ manner/NN was/VBD not/RB effusive./VB It/PRP seldom/RB was;/VBP but/CC he/PRP was/VBD glad,/NN I/PRP think,/VBP 
to/TO see/VB me./FW With/IN hardly/RB a/DT word/NN spoken,/NN but/CC with/IN a/DT kindly/RB eye,/NN he/PRP waved/VBD 
me/PRP to/TO an/DT armchair,/NN threw/VBD across/IN his/PRP$ case/NN of/IN cigars,/NN and/CC indicated/VBD a/DT 
spirit/NN case/NN and/CC a/DT gasogene/NN in/IN the/DT corner./NN Then/RB he/PRP stood/VBD before/IN the/DT fire/NN 
and/CC looked/VBD me/PRP over/IN in/IN his/PRP$ singular/JJ introspective/JJ fashion./NN 
“Wedlock/NN suits/NNS you,”/VBP he/PRP remarked./VB “I/NN think,/IN Watson,/NN that/IN you/PRP have/VBP put/VBN 
on/IN seven/CD and/CC a/DT half/NN pounds/NNS since/IN I/PRP saw/VBD you.”/NN 
“Seven!”/NN I/PRP answered./VBP 
“Indeed,/NN I/NN should/MD have/VB thought/VBN a/DT little/JJ more./JJR Just/RB a/DT trifle/RB more,/JJR I/PRP

that/IN you/PRP intended/VBD to/TO go/VB into/IN harness.”/NN 
“Then,/NN how/WRB do/VBP you/PRP know?”/VB 
“I/NN see/VBP it,/NN I/PRP deduce/VBP it./RB How/WRB do/VBP I/PRP know/VB that/IN you/PRP have/VBP been/VBN getting/VBG 
yourself/PRP very/RB wet/JJ lately,/NN and/CC that/IN you/PRP have/VBP a/DT most/RBS clumsy/JJ and/CC careless/JJ 
servant/JJ girl?”/NN 
“My/NN dear/RB Holmes,”/NNP said/VBD I,/NNP “this/NNP is/VBZ too/RB much./JJ You/PRP would/MD certainly/RB have/VB 
been/VBN burned,/NN had/VBD you/PRP lived/VBD a/DT few/JJ centuries/NNS ago./VBP It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN I/PRP had/VBD a/DT 
country/NN walk/NN on/IN Thursday/NNP and/CC came/VBD home/NN in/IN a/DT dreadful/JJ mess,/NN but/CC as/IN I/PRP 
have/VB changed/VBN my/PRP$ clothes/NNS I/PRP can’t/VBP imagine/VB how/WRB you/PRP deduce/VBP it./RB As/IN to/TO Mary/NNP

again,/IN I/PRP fail/VBP to/TO see/VB how/WRB you/PRP work/VBP it/PRP out.”/VB 
He/PRP chuckled/VBD to/TO himself/PRP and/CC rubbed/VBD his/PRP$ long,/NN nervous/JJ hands/NNS together./IN 
“It/NN is/VBZ simplicity/NN itself,”/NN said/VBD he;/NN “my/JJ eyes/NNS tell/VBP me/PRP that/WDT on/IN the/DT inside/NN

I/PRP could/MD not/RB help/VB laughing/VBG at/IN the/DT ease/NN with/IN which/WDT he/PRP explained/VBD his/PRP$ 
process/NN of/IN deduction./NN “When/NN I/PRP hear/VBP you/PRP give/VB your/PRP$ reasons,”/NN I/PRP remarked,/VBP 
“the/JJ thing/NN always/RB appears/VBZ to/TO me/PRP to/TO be/VB so/RB ridiculously/RB simple/JJ that/IN I/PRP

believe/VB that/IN my/PRP$ eyes/NNS are/VBP as/RB good/JJ as/IN yours.”/NN 
“Quite/JJ so,”/NN he/PRP answered,/VBD lighting/VBG a/DT cigarette,/NN and/CC throwing/VBG himself/PRP 
down/RB into/IN an/DT armchair./NN “You/NN see,/NN but/CC you/PRP do/VBP not/RB observe./VB The/DT

“Frequently.”/NN 
“How/NN often?”/NN 
“Well,/VB some/DT hundreds/NNS of/IN times.”/NN 
“Then/VB how/WRB many/JJ are/VBP there?”/IN 
“How/NN many?/NN I/PRP don’t/VBP know.”/IN 
“Quite/JJ so!/NN You/PRP have/VBP not/RB observed./VB And/CC yet/RB you/PRP have/VBP seen./VBN That/DT is/VBZ just/RB 
my/PRP$ point./NN Now,/NN I/PRP know/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP seventeen/CD steps,/NN because/IN I/PRP have/VBP

of/IN my/PRP$ trifling/JJ experiences,/NN you/PRP may/MD be/VB interested/JJ in/IN this.”/JJ He/PRP threw/VBD 
over/IN a/DT sheet/NN of/IN thick,/JJ pink-tinted/JJ notepaper/NN which/WDT had/VBD been/VBN lying/VBG open/JJ 
upon/IN the/DT table./NN “It/NN came/VBD by/IN the/DT last/JJ post,”/NN said/VBD he./NN “Read/NN it/PRP aloud.”/IN 
The/DT note/NN was/VBD undated,/JJ and/CC without/IN either/CC signature/NN or/CC address./NN 
“There/NNP will/MD call/VB upon/IN you/PRP to-night,/VBP at/IN a/DT quarter/NN to/TO eight/CD o’clock,”/CD it/PRP 
said,/JJ “a/NN gentleman/NN who/WP desires/NNS to/TO consult/VB you/PRP upon/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN the/DT very/RB 
deepest/JJS moment./FW Your/PRP$ recent/JJ services/NNS to/TO one/CD of/IN the/DT royal/JJ houses/NNS of/IN

This/DT account/NN of/IN you/PRP we/PRP have/VBP from/IN all/DT quarters/NNS received./VBP Be/VB in/IN your/PRP$

wear/VB a/DT mask.”/NN 
“This/NNP is/VBZ indeed/RB a/DT mystery,”/NN I/PRP remarked./VBP “What/NN do/VBP you/PRP imagine/VB that/IN it/PRP 
means?”/NN 
“I/NN have/VBP no/DT data/NNS yet./VBP It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT capital/NN mistake/NN to/TO theorise/VB before/IN one/CD has/VBZ

it?”/NN 
I/PRP carefully/RB examined/VBD the/DT writing,/NN and/CC the/DT paper/NN upon/IN which/WDT it/PRP was/VBD 
written./NN 
“The/NN man/NN who/WP wrote/VBD it/PRP was/VBD presumably/RB well/RB to/TO do,”/VB I/PRP remarked,/VB 
endeavouring/VBG to/TO imitate/VB my/PRP$ companion’s/NNS processes./VBP “Such/JJ paper/NN could/MD not/RB 
be/VB bought/VBN under/IN half/PDT a/DT crown/NN a/DT packet./NNP It/PRP is/VBZ peculiarly/RB strong/JJ and/CC 
stiff.”/NN 
“Peculiar—that/NN is/VBZ the/DT very/RB word,”/JJ said/VBD Holmes./NNP “It/NNP is/VBZ not/RB an/DT English/NNP 
paper/NN at/IN all./NNP Hold/VB it/PRP up/RP to/TO the/DT light.”/NN 
I/PRP did/VBD so,/NN and/CC saw/VBD a/DT large/JJ “E”/NN with/IN a/DT small/JJ “g,”/NN a/DT “P,”/NN and/CC a/DT large/JJ “G”/NN 
with/IN a/DT small/JJ “t”/NN woven/VBN into/IN the/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT paper./NN 
“What/NN do/VBP you/PRP make/VB of/IN that?”/JJ asked/VBD Holmes./NNP 
“The/NN name/NN of/IN the/DT maker,/NN no/DT doubt;/NN or/CC his/PRP$ monogram,/JJ rather.”/NN 
“Not/NN at/IN all./JJ The/DT ‘G’/NN with/IN the/DT small/JJ ‘t’/NN stands/VBZ for/IN ‘Gesellschaft,’/NN 
which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT German/JJ for/IN ‘Company.’/NNP It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT customary/JJ contraction/NN like/IN 
our/PRP$ ‘Co.’/NN ‘P,’/NN of/IN course,/NN stands/VBZ for/IN ‘Papier.’/NNP Now/RB for/IN the/DT ‘Eg.’/NNP Let/VB us/PRP

from/IN his/PRP$ cigarette./NN 
“The/JJ paper/NN was/VBD made/VBN in/IN Bohemia,”/NN I/PRP said./VBP 
“Precisely./NNP And/CC the/DT man/NN who/WP wrote/VBD the/DT note/NN is/VBZ a/DT German./NNP Do/VBP you/PRP note/VB the/DT

As/IN he/PRP spoke/VBD there/EX was/VBD the/DT sharp/JJ sound/NN of/IN horses’/NN hoofs/NNS and/CC grating/VBG

“A/NN pair,/NN by/IN the/DT sound,”/NN said/VBD he./NN “Yes,”/NN he/PRP continued,/VBD glancing/VBG out/IN of/IN

“I/NN think/VBP that/IN I/PRP had/VBD better/JJR go,/NN Holmes.”/NN 
“Not/NN a/DT bit,/NN Doctor./NNP Stay/NNP where/WRB you/PRP are./VBP I/PRP am/VBP lost/VBN without/IN my/PRP$ Boswell./NN

A/DT slow/JJ and/CC heavy/JJ step,/NN which/WDT had/VBD been/VBN heard/VBN upon/IN the/DT stairs/NNS and/CC in/IN the/DT

III./NNP A/NNP CASE/NN OF/IN IDENTITY/NN 
“My/NN dear/RB fellow,”/RB said/VBD Sherlock/NNP Holmes/NNP as/IN we/PRP sat/VBD on/IN either/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT

“And/NN yet/RB I/PRP am/VBP not/RB convinced/VBN of/IN it,”/NN I/PRP answered./VBP “The/NN cases/NNS which/WDT come/VBP

“A/NN certain/JJ selection/NN and/CC discretion/NN must/MD be/VB used/VBN in/IN producing/VBG a/DT

I/PRP smiled/VBD and/CC shook/VBD my/PRP$ head./NN “I/NN can/MD quite/RB understand/VB your/PRP$ thinking/VBG so,”/NN

“Indeed,/NN your/PRP$ example/NN is/VBZ an/DT unfortunate/JJ one/CD for/IN your/PRP$ argument,”/NN said/VBD
